# Flappy Bird Controller

<img src=images/flappy-bird-3.jpg width="300" />

The aim of this project is to develop an interactive controller app through MATLAB app designer to play the game autonomously. The control algorithm is implemented by bang-bang control and PID control. Besides, all controller’s parameters can be tuned in app’s interface and the trajectory of bird and tubes can be drawn in real time.

## Features
- A flappy bird controller implemented in ***MATLAB app designer***.
- It supports ***bang-bang*** and ***PID control***
- The heighest score is ***135 for bang-bang*** and there is ***no limit for PID***.
- A vedio [demo](docs/demo.mp4) is inclued.
- For more detials, please check the report paper in [docs](docs).

## Quick Start

1. Check out this repository and download the source code

    `git clone git@github.com:silvery107/flappy-bird-pid-gui.git`

2. Open code inside ***MATLAB***, this project is implemented under version ***2020b***.
3. Directly run `flappybird_controller_exported.m` or install the app ***Flappy Bird Controller.mlappinstall***
